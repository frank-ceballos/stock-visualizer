# Stock Visualizer
Due to the lack of visualization tools for stocks, we will create a Python
based web application that can retrieve historical stock and visualize using
line graphs and candle stick charts. The user will need to provide a list
of tickers, a start date, and end date. All the development is happening in
the `dev` branch.

There is no fun in `main`.
